2. What is meant by escaping a character?
   Escaping a character means using a special syntax to ensure certain characters are interpreted literally rather than 
   as part of the code syntax. For example, in URLs, special characters like &, ?, and = are escaped using percent-
   encoding (%20 for space, %26 for &, etc.) to prevent confusion with URL syntax.

     c. 401
        Unauthorized: The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.

     d. 403
        Forbidden: The client’s request is understood by the server, but it refuses to authorize it.

     e. 404
        Not Found: The server can’t find the requested resource.

     f. 500

4. Why do we need to validate data?
   Data validation is essential for ensuring the integrity, consistency, and security of data input from users. It helps
   prevent errors and security vulnerabilities; for example, validating and sanitizing inputs helps prevent Cross-Site 
   Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers inject malicious scripts into a web application. If data isn’t validated, 
   harmful code could be executed in users’ browsers, compromising sensitive information. Data validation also ensures 
   data consistency and reliability. It makes sure the data is in the correct format, making it easier to store, process, 
   and retrieve without errors. It also helps improve user experience, providing immediate feedback on incorrect inputs, 
   helping users enter the correct information.

5. What are sessions and cookies? What do they do?
   Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client side, allowing websites to remember information across requests
   (e.g., login state, user preferences). They are in the frontend of a website.
   Sessions are server-side storage that tracks user interactions across multiple requests, often identified by a 
   session ID stored in a cookie. they are used in the backend of a website.
